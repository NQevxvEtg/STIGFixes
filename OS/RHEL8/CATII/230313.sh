# STIG Check & Fix for RHEL-08-010150 (Corrected Version)
#
# Rule Title: RHEL 8 must disable core dumps for all users.
#
# Description:
# This script ensures that core dumps are disabled for all users by setting
# a hard limit of 0. It creates a high-precedence configuration file in
# /etc/security/limits.d/ and comments out any other conflicting 'core'
# limit definitions.
# ===================================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
DESIRED_SETTING="* hard core 0"
# Use a file with a high number to ensure it's processed last.
CONFIG_FILE="/etc/security/limits.d/99-disable-core-dumps.conf"

# --- Color Codes for Output ---
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# --- Helper Functions for Logging ---
